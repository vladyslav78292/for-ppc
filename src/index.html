    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section__title">IPL Match Betting</h2>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Indian bettors are using a variety of betting markets when placing IPL bets. Top online bookmakers like Bettilt make sure to include the most popular options, as well as some special markets. That way, you can enjoy the IPL match betting as you please.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Among the most used IPL betting markets are the match winner, tied match, innings 1 over/under, top batsman, player to score a century, top wicket-taker, etc. Most of these markets are also available for live betting.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">You can find these betting markets at any event on the IPL match schedule. If you aren't familiar with the meaning of a market, then make sure to learn about it before using it.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="section__title">IPL Odds</h2>
      <p class="section__paragraph">The IPL odds and the amount you are willing to bet determine your potential payout. Bookmakers calculate this sum by multiplying the odds with your stake. Let's say that the Chennai Super Kings are playing against the Delhi Capitals. In the table below you can see the winning odds of both teams.</p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph"><strong>Team</strong></p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph"><strong>Winning Odds</strong></p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph">Chennai Super Kings</p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph">1.62</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph">Delhi Capitals</p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p class="section__paragraph">2.30</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Now, if we back Chennai Super Kings to win the match with a bet of INR1,000, we can potentially win INR1,620. However, if we add more selections on our bet slip, then the potential payout will increase. This is because the IPL betting odds multiply each other and then they multiply with the bet amount.</p>

      <p class="section__paragraph">Now it's time to introduce you to the IPL teams that are competing in this popular cricket league. Below we will list and describe only the top 5 IPL teams 2024.</p>
      <ul class="section__ordered-list list-dots">
        <li class="element-number">Gujarat Titans</li>
        <li class="element-number">Chennai Super Kings</li>
        <li class="element-number">Mumbai Indians</li>

      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section__title">Gujarat Titans</h3>
      <p class="section__paragraph">The Gujarat Titans are a team from Ahmedabad, Gujarat that began competing in 2022. Despite its lack of experience, this young team managed to win the IPL title in the 2022 season. They are also the favourite to win the IPL 2024, but that is just according to the bookmakers.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Last season, the Gujarat Titans were 1<sup>st</sup> in the league but lost to Chennai Super Kings in both the quarter-finals and the final. It's fair to say that they have one of the best squads in the whole IPL.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section__title">Chennai Super Kings</h3>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Next, we have the Chennai Super Kings, a team from Chennai, Tamil Nadu that has a long history in the IPL. They feature 5 IPL titles, the same as the Mumbai Indians, making them the teams with the most titles.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">The Chennai Super Kings are also the current IPL champion, after winning the 2023 season against the Gujarat Titans. They hold the record for appearing in the most finals (10) and for the most playoff qualifications (12). This team also features two titles in the CLT20.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">It is worth noting that this team didn't play in the IPL in seasons 2016 and 2017, due to suspension. This was due to their owners' involvement in the 2013 betting case.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section__title">Mumbai Indians</h3>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Mumbai Indians is another legendary team that has been competing in the IPL since 2008. They play their home matches in Mumbai, Maharashtra and they feature 5 IPL titles, just like the Chennai Super Kings.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Last season, they lost to the Gujarat Titans in the semi-finals, after beating Lucknow Super Giants in the quarter-finals. Their last title in the IPL was in 2020 and they are hungrier than ever for a new success. It is also worth noting that the Mumbai Indians feature two titles in the CLT20.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section__title">Rajasthan Royals</h3>
      <p class="section__paragraph">The Rajasthan Royals are also one of the teams that are playing in the IPL right from the beginning. Since its establishment in 2008, this team managed to win the league once. That was actually the first year of the IPL. After this major success, the Rajasthan Royals are struggling to repeat its glory.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">However, they are still among the favourites as they feature a strong squad. Rajasthan Royals were close to winning the IPL 2022, but the Gujarat Titans were slightly better than them. Last season they failed to qualify for the playoffs after finishing at the 5<sup>th</sup> spot.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section__title">Lucknow Super Giants</h3>
      <p class="section__paragraph">Lastly, we have the Lucknow Super Giants, another young team that started competing in 2022. During their first season, they finished in the 3<sup>rd</sup> position but failed to qualify for the semi-finals.</p>
      <p class="section__paragraph">In 2023, this team ended up in the same league position. Yet, they once again lost their quarter-final match. Many look at these seasons as failures, but they have to remember that this is still a young team. If they continue with their progress then they can surely dream of winning the IPL title.</p>
