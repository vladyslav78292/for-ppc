          regulate the implementation of promotions. Notwithstanding the appropriateness or 
          accuracy of any of the provisions, the remaining Promotional Terms will remain in

          accepted the Terms, including these Promotional Terms, and we have the right to make 
          final and binding decisions.</p>

        <p class="section__title">5: Bonuses and Bonus Money</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.1</span> There are various types of bonuses on the Website, including free spins, cashback, 
          free bets and extra money received after making a deposit. Wagering requirements 
          must usually be met in order to withdraw bonus funds following a bonus. If you intend to
          use the bonus, we recommend that you read the bonus rules.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.2</span> Casino has a wagering requirement of 30 times the bonus money and sportsbooks 
          have a wagering requirement of 10 times. For certain promotions, different terms and 
          conditions may apply, provided that they are properly stated.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.3</span> When you bet on a bonus, the amount you must deposit before it and your 
          winnings are ready to be withdrawn, is known as the wagering requirement. Depending 
          on the specific bonus requirements, wagering requirements are expressed as a multiple
          of the bonus amount or a multiple of the bonus amount plus the deposit amount. The 
          terms specific to a bonus will specify the wagering requirement. The wagering 
          requirements do not apply to all bets. Betting bets on Casino Hold'em, 2 Ways Royal, 
          Craps and Sic Bo games, Blackjack, Roulette, Arcade games (Heads or Better, Dice 
          Twister, etc.) or Video poker games (Jacks or Better, Aces and Faces, etc.) are included 
          in your wagering requirements to the extent that they are. Betting contributions for 
          table games are 10%, while Sic Bo, Royal Craps, Baccarat, Red Dog and Bac Bo are 0%. 
          In most slots, the contribution is 100%. Please check the Website customer support 
          every time you want to know what the betting contribution is for a particular game. 
          These percentages can change from time to time, so be sure to contact them each time
          to find out what happened.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.4</span> The wagering requirements must be met before the withdrawal can be made, 
          otherwise you will lose your bonus money. The customer support will help you if you 
          decide to withdraw money.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.5</span> Before forfeiting bonuses, users may contact Website customer support to cancel 
          their bonus balance.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.6</span>  The Website offers free spins that allow you to play for free, but have the same 
          chance of winning as if you were playing for real money. Before you can withdraw 
          winnings from free spins, you usually need to deposit a certain amount of money.</p>
        <p class="section__paragraph"><span class="yellowpoint">5.7</span> In Evolution's "Gold Bar Roulette" game, winnings from bets made with Gold Bars 
          are credited as bonus funds, and this is followed by wagering requirements before funds
          are withdrawn.</p>

          proof of identity, monitoring suspicious transactions, performing AML and anti-fraud 
          checks, and requesting more information and documents.</p>
